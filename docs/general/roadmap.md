# App Center Product Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> We've **moved our product roadmap** to the [App Center GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter). Read below to learn more, or just jump into the repo to see what our plans are.

To more actively engage with our customers, we've moved our public roadmap to the [App Center GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter). Your comments create an open dialog between us and customers. This change also lets others see the feedback you share.

- Got a feature request and don’t know what to do with it? Add it as a feature to the repository. 
- Like to change how a feature works? Let us know. 
- See someone else’s feature or comment that looks interesting? Give it a Thumbs Up or a +1 so we know you agree. Be sure to search the existing issues first before adding a new one to help us avoid duplicates.

The GitHub repository isn't where you'll get [product support](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/help). When you have issues, problems, or questions about App Center and how App Center works; use the 'Contact support' option under the help menu (?) in the upper right corner of App Center portal. Our support team is there to answer your questions and help you solve your problems.
